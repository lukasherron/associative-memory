* The hopfield_network.py file requires that the array2gif library is install. If it is not installed then all of the lines which call an array2gif function must be commented out in the evolve_network() definition.


* The network includes classes for the traditional Hopfield network (Hopfield 1982), as well as a variant with time delay synaptic connections (Sompolinsky 1986) and a variant with a dynamical threshold (Horn 1989).

* See example.py for an example of how to simulate a Hopfield or Hopfield variant network
